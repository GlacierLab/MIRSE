## How to use
1. Install original game from [itch.io](https://calaris.itch.io/mysterious-island). We only tested `MYSTERIOUSISLAND_FULL_1.02_ENG.exe` works, other versions are not tested but you can try.  
2. Clone this repository and open folder.  
3. Ensure you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20 or later version and added to PATH.  
4. Run `Install.bat` to complete the installation.  
5. Run `Launch.bat` to start the server. After installation you only need to do this step each time before start the game.
6. Now you can simply run the game `TheMysteriousIsland.exe`, enjoy the game!
